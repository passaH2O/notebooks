Notebooks developed by the PassaH2O group.

`NWM_A&A_retrospective.ipynb`: Notebook for retrieval of hourly retrospective analysis & assimilation and forcing streamflow data from the National Water Model. A stream's discharge hydrograph can then be extracted from the retrieved files and plotted.

`GeoFlood_demo.ipynb`: Notebook that performs all operations in the GeoFlood workflow to obtain flood inundation extent and depth based on a hydrological forecast of discharge.
